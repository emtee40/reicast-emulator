plan:
-figure out the mic commands that seaman is looking for and implement them
-create mic test app (consult bluecrab)
-figure out how the game/dc requests the audio (or how the mic just streams)...
-for poc just create some kind of global way to pass the audio data from android mic interface directly to the maple_base instance
-cleanup
